# fzf

my own version of fzf written in lua

## Future plans
Create a terminal auto-complete with this fzf.
Using Ollama and a custom algorithm for best next token prediction.

## Author's note
Thanks to junegunn we have a wonderful tool.

I love to use fuzzy finder in my bash scripts, most of my scripts have use of fzf.
Not to forget we have our tmux-sessionizer another great script written by [ThePrimeagen](http://github.com/ThePrimeagen),
which makes it easier to create sessions from any directory in your system.
Perfect use of tmux and fzf I would say.
